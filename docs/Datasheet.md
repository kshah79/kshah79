# Schematic Functionality vs. Requirements

Our final HMI‚Äêcentric schematic brings together power, processing, user I/O, and communications into a single coherent PCB layout. Key functional elements include:

- **Power Distribution & Regulation**  
   - A 9 V barrel‚Äêjack input feeds the AP63203WU-7 buck regulator, which provides a stable 3.3 V rail for all logic and peripherals.  
   - Decoupling capacitors and ferrite beads isolate the ESP32‚Äôs Wi-Fi bursts from sensitive sensor and display circuits.  
   - This arrangement meets our requirement for **reliable, low‚Äênoise power** under both high-current (LCD backlight, Wi-Fi) and low-current (sensors) modes.

- **Microcontroller & Peripheral Interfaces**  
   - The ESP32‚Äôs UART pins are wired to the daisy-chain header, enabling both **upstream sensor queries** and **downstream motor commands** without additional multiplexers.  
   - SPI lines to the ILI9341 display (SCK, MOSI, CS, DC, RST) are laid out as short, impedance-controlled traces, ensuring **fast, glitch-free updates** (<50 ms) in response to new sensor frames.  
   - I¬≤C pins remain free for future local sensors, satisfying our **scalability** requirement.

- **User Controls & Feedback**  
   - Two push-buttons routed to GPIO16/17 give users manual ‚ÄúRefresh‚Äù and ‚ÄúOverride Flow‚Äù control, with 10 kŒ© pull-ups and debounce capacitors ensuring **clean, chatter-free inputs**.  
   - The 2.4‚Ä≥ TFT display is centrally placed and backlit via a dedicated MOSFET, providing **clear, colorful real-time feedback** for exhibit visitors.

- **Wireless Connectivity**  
   - The ESP32‚Äôs antenna clearance zone and ground plane keep RF performance optimal, delivering **robust MQTT connectivity** for remote monitoring.

Together, these elements deliver on our product requirements for **real-time local feedback**, **remote cloud updates**, **user-driven control**, and **educational transparency**, all while maintaining a compact, single-board form factor.

# Design & Decision‚ÄêMaking Process for the Schematic

- **Requirement Mapping**  
   - We began by listing every functional requirement (power budget, UI responsiveness, communication paths, safety margins) and mapping them onto schematic blocks.  
   - Power requirements drove regulator and decoupling choices; latency targets drove PCB trace layout for SPI/UART.

- **Component Footprint & Placement**  
   - We grouped high-noise/high-current components (buck regulator, backlight MOSFET) away from analog lines.  
   - The ESP32 was placed centrally to minimize trace lengths to both the daisychained UART header and the display connectors.

- **Signal Integrity Considerations**  
   - SPI and UART lines were routed as differential‚Äêlike pairs with consistent trace impedance.  
   - Pull-ups, series resistors, and ferrites were added to critical lines after lab-demo feedback showed occasional framing errors under load.

- **Iterative Feedback Incorporation**  
   - After the first revision, TA feedback highlighted that our ‚ÄúOverride Flow‚Äù button lacked proper debounce. We added a 0.1 ¬µF capacitor and 10 kŒ© resistor per channel.  
   - Peer review noted Wi-Fi dropouts; we increased the antenna clearance area and added a ground-shield trace.

- **Validation & Final Checks**  
   - We performed a DRC/DRU check in the CAD tool, then built a rapid prototype to verify power stability, button response, and display updates before freezing the schematic.

# Version 2.0 Hardware Improvements

Looking ahead to a ‚ÄúVersion 2.0‚Äù of this PCB, we would target the following enhancements:

- **Integrated Sensor Daughter-Cards**  
   - **Why**: Right now, external sensors connect via the I¬≤C bus. Adding small mezzanine connectors for plug-in modules (e.g., BME280, light sensors) would simplify K-12 reconfiguration and reduce wiring errors.  
   - **Benefit**: Increases the exhibit‚Äôs modularity and hands-on learning potential.

- **On-Board Motor Driver MOSFETs**  
   - **Why**: Currently, motor control flows through the HMI board only as commands; a dedicated MOSFET stage on the HMI board would allow low-power test actuators (e.g., small fans) directly from this PCB.  
   - **Benefit**: Enables standalone demo setups without needing the separate motor PCB.

- **USB-C Power & Debug Port**  
   - **Why**: Switching from a barrel jack to USB-C PD would modernize the power interface and allow in-circuit debugging/programming via the same connector.  
   - **Benefit**: Simplifies lab setup and future firmware updates, crucial for iterative educational projects.

- **Enhanced Display Touch Integration**  
   - **Why**: Replacing the ILI9341 with a touch-capable TFT (e.g., FT81x series) would provide intuitive, touchscreen controls for data refresh and flow override.  
   - **Benefit**: Improves user engagement and reduces the need for discrete buttons, streamlining the UX.

- **Power Monitoring & Telemetry**  
   - **Why**: Adding current-sense resistors and an INA219/INA226 chip on the 3.3 V rail would let us monitor real-time power consumption and display it on the TFT or in the cloud dashboard.  
   - **Benefit**: Deepens the educational value by teaching students about power management and system diagnostics.

These Version 2.0 improvements build directly on our existing schematic footprint and trace layout, leveraging freed-up I¬≤C lines and header pin reserves. They would further satisfy **scalability**, **usability**, and **educational richness** for future iterations.
