## Title: Meeting Coordination

1. **What method will you use to remind yourselves of meetings (a shared calendar?)**

   Group text reminders.

2. **How will your team go about changing or adding meeting times?**

   Group text and finding what times work for the team. Sometimes in-person meetings will not be available for everybody, so depending on the situation, the team would have to discover what is necessary to get the required communication.

3. **What's the preferred format for meetings (face-to-face or virtually)?**

   Face-to-face is ideal for most situations. However, for assignments that are already mentioned, late-night hours work for most individuals. The available hours are a key factor in scheduling meetings.

4. **Are there any other procedures that your team feels are necessary? Describe them.**

   To-do lists and identifying who is best suited for each task, while ensuring no one works alone on any singular task.

## Roles and Responsibilities:

| Team Member           | Role                    |
|-----------------------|-------------------------|

| Kevin Shah            | Documentation Head      |
| Sanjit                | Electrical Head         |
| Siddhant              | PCB Head                |

## Process by which each team member will fulfill each project role and responsibility:

The team will communicate and volunteer for each role based on what they believe is most impactful toward creating a successful outcome. Identifying who is most tactful at specific tasks will help kick-start this process.

## Additional Questions:

1. **How often will you change project roles?**

   Team members will change roles as the class demands and depending on the needs of the project.

2. **How will you decide who is assigned to each role?**

   The team will decide collectively, ensuring that roles align with the tasks that need to be accomplished.

3. **How will team members help one another meet their responsibilities?**

   Team members will be responsible for taking action, answering communication, and stepping up to new work. Each member is expected to contribute a plan of action to meet team goals. The assignment leader or project manager will oversee and ensure roles are fulfilled.

4. **How will you identify and respond to situations in which the team must adjust roles and responsibilities?**

   If roles need to change, the team will act quickly and decisively based on the consequences of the situation.

5. **How will you track the team activities and milestones?**

   By using to-do lists that are regularly updated and communicated through the team's group chat.

6. **How will you assign technical responsibilities to the team members?**

   The assignment leader or project manager will assign technical responsibilities for tasks, while the meeting leader ensures understanding of the current to-do list.

## Team Coordination & Accountability

- **Assignment Deadlines:** Establish clear deadlines for each assignment and communicate them to all team members.

- **Progress Checkpoints:** Implement intermediate checkpoints to review progress and ensure tasks are on track.

- **Final Review:** Schedule a final review meeting before the submission deadline where each team member reviews and "signs off" on the assignment.

- **Knowledge and Skill Requirements:** Conduct an initial assessment to identify each team member's strengths and areas for improvement. This will be done through a simple team interview.

- **Training and Resources:** Provide necessary training and resources to fill any knowledge gaps.

- **Mentorship:** We will pair less experienced members with mentors who can guide them through the assignment.

- **Feedback Distribution and Action:** Use Google Drive to collect and distribute feedback from design reviews.

- **Action Plan:** Develop a clear action plan based on feedback, assigning specific tasks to team members.

- **Follow-Up Meetings:** Schedule follow-up meetings to ensure feedback has been acted upon and improvements have been made.

## Addressing Missed Contributions and Accountability

- **Missed Contributions:** Address missed contributions immediately through direct communication with the involved team member.

- **Root Cause Analysis:** Identify the reasons for the missed contribution and provide support to resolve any issues.

- **Reassignment:** If necessary, reassign tasks to ensure project continuity.

- **Accountability:** Clearly define and communicate expectations for each team member.

- **Regular Check-Ins:** Hold regular check-in meetings to monitor progress and address any issues early.

- **Peer Accountability:** Encourage team members to hold each other accountable through open and respectful communication.

- **Recognizing and Addressing Underperformance:** Regularly monitor each team member's performance against set expectations.

- **Support and Improvement Plan:** If a team member is underperforming, provide constructive feedback and develop a support plan to help them improve.

- **Consequences:** If there is no improvement despite support, the team must consider implementing consequences such as reassigning tasks or, in extreme cases, issuing a "pink slip" to remove the team member from the project.
