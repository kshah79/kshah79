Title: Meeting Coordination
---

1. What method will you use to remind yourselves of meetings (a shared calendar?)

Group text reminders.

2. How will your team go about changing or adding meeting times?

Group text and finding what times work for the team. Sometimes in person meetings will not be available for everybody so depending on the situation the team would have to discover what is necessary in order to get necessary communication.

3. What's the preferred format for meetings (face-to-face or virtually)?

Face to face is ideal for most situations however for assignments that are already mentioned late night hours is what works for most individuals however hours to meet is the forefront of this meeting creation.

4. Are there any other procedures that your team feels are necessary? Describe them.

To do lists and finding who is best at what while always ensuring that no one goes at a singular task alone for any reason.

Process by which each team member will fulfill each project role and responsibility:
---
The team will need to communicate and volunteer for each individual role based on what they believe is the most impactful towards creating a successful team. Who is more tactful at what would be a great starter question for this process.

---
Additional Questions:
---

- How often will you change project roles?
Team members will change the project roles according to what the class demands of the team.

- How will you decide who is assigned to each role?
The team will decide who occupies what role by collectively deciding what will need to be accomplished by the team.

- How will team members help one another meet their responsibilities?

By being responsible and stepping up to the task of getting quality work forward, the team will ensure that everyone meets what the team decides as being a responsible team member. A responsible team member fulfills their role, answers communication, steps up and takes action on new work, and a responsable member puts forward a plan of action to get what the team needs to get done. All processes for the team would need to be agreed upon by the assignment leader or project manager due to their responsibility in either assignments or projects.

- How will you identify and respond to situations in which the team must adjust roles and responsibilities?

The team identifies this matter by the consequences of the teams actions. If a situation arrises in which a role must change the team will take action quickly and decisively. 

- How will you track the team activities and milestones?

By our to-do lists that need to be regularly communicated on our teams group chat. 

- How will you assign technical responsibilities to the team members?

The team assignment leader or project manager will make this responsibility for assignments or projects while the meeting leader is responsible in ensuring that team members understand the current to-do lists.

Team Coordination & Accountability
---

Assignment Deadlines: Establish clear deadlines for each assignment and communicate them to all team members.

Progress Checkpoints: Implement intermediate checkpoints to review progress and ensure tasks are on track.
Final Review: Schedule a final review meeting before the submission deadline where each team member reviews and "signs off" on the assignment.

Knowledge and Skill Requirements: Conduct an initial assessment to identify each team member's strengths and areas for improvement. For this situation it will be a simple team interview. 

Training and Resources: Provide necessary training and resources to fill any knowledge gaps.

Mentorship: Pair less experienced members with mentors who can guide them through the assignment.

Feedback Distribution and Action: Use Google Drive  to collect and distribute feedback from design reviews.

Action Plan: Develop a clear action plan based on the feedback, assigning specific tasks to team members to address the feedback.

Follow-Up Meetings: Schedule follow-up meetings to ensure feedback has been acted upon and improvements have been made.
Addressing Missed Contributions and Accountability

Missed Contributions: Address missed contributions immediately through direct communication with the involved team member.

Root Cause Analysis: Identify the reasons for the missed contribution and provide support to resolve any issues.

Reassignment: If necessary, reassign tasks to ensure project continuity.

Accountability: Clearly define and communicate expectations for each team member.

Regular Check-Ins: Hold regular check-in meetings to monitor progress and address any issues early.

Peer Accountability: Encourage team members to hold each other accountable through open and respectful communication.

Recognizing and Addressing Underperformance: Regularly monitor each team member's performance against set expectations.

Support and Improvement Plan: If a team member is underperforming, provide constructive feedback and develop a support plan to help them improve.

Consequences: If there is no improvement despite support, the team must consider implementing consequences such as reassigning tasks or, in extreme cases, issuing a "pink slip" to remove the team member from the project.
